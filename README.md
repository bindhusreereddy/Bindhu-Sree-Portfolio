# Alla Bindhu Sree Reddy - Personal Portfolio

Welcome to the source code for my personal portfolio website. This project is a responsive, single-page application designed to showcase my skills, professional experience, and the projects I've worked on. It's built with clean HTML, modern CSS, and dynamic JavaScript to create an engaging user experience.

###  üöÄ Getting Started

This is a static website, so no complex setup is required to run it locally.

**Prerequisites:**
* A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
* A code editor like VS Code (optional, for development).

**Installation & Setup:**

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/bindhusreereddy/your-portfolio-repo.git](https://github.com/bindhusreereddy/your-portfolio-repo.git)
    ```
    *(Replace `your-portfolio-repo` with your actual repository name)*

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd your-portfolio-repo
    ```

3.  **Open in your browser:**
    Simply open the `index.html` file directly in your web browser to view the portfolio.

    For the best development experience, I recommend using the **Live Server** extension in Visual Studio Code, which provides live reloading.
